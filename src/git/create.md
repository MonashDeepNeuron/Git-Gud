# Creating a Repository

To create a repository you first want to create a new directory. Then you can initialise this directory as the root of your new repo.

```sh
# Make a new directory/folder to be the root of your new repo
mkdir project

# Navigate into the root directory
cd project

# Initialise your new repo
git init
```

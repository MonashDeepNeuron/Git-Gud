# Installing Git

It is really simple to install, instructions and binaries can be obtained from its [official download](https://git-scm.com/download) page. Select your target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) to see the various options for install Git.

> Note: On Windows, you will have to got through an install Wizard. Customize the installation to whatever you see fit but you must tick the option for added Git to your system `%PATH%` or 'PATH'.

For the purposes of the this book, we will assume you are using a Bash-based terminal. This is just the regular shell on Linux and macOS. You can use the Git Bash Shell that installs with Git on Windows.

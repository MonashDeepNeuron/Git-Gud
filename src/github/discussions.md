# Discussions

Discussions are places where you can ask questions, share ideas or have general conversations that aren't necessarily Issues. This can be a great place to discuss ideas or get further information on how to use a project or even collaborate on it. It is also beneficial to the maintainers as it can help surface things missing in th projects official documentation.

Discussions are very much like the Discussion Threads from Issues and PRs. You can comment, react with emojis and even upvote posts and comments. Top level comments are also individual items which can be replied to directly making it easier to focus on sub topics generated by comments. On Q&A discussions you can also mark particular comments as the answer like a mini StackOverflow.

Discussions can also be converted into an Issue making it easier to transfer a conversation that was once a Discussion into an Issue if the discussion resulting in an Issue being found or surfaced a desired feature from the community.

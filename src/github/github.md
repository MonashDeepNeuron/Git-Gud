# GitHub

GitHub is a remote Git service. This allows you to store Git repositories online so that individuals and teams can access and work on Git repositories and projects remotely. It offers many features on top of basic version control such as branch, issue and feature tracking, releases, CI/CD pipelines, project management and more. Its predominately used through its website which offers control of these features through a simple GUI. Throughout your time at Monash DeepNeuron, university and probably for the rest of your career (if in a software based role), you will use service like GitHub to help management the development of projects.

Your first task is to sign up for a GitHub account, if you haven't already. I would highly recommend using a personal email address (not a university one) as you will most likely want access to your account after university.

It is also a good idea to install the GitHub mobile app. This allows you track and manage projects and reply to messages and issues from your phone.

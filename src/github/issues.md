# Issues

Issues are a fundamental tool for users and collaborators to express faults in a codebase and track the progression to fixing those faults. Issues are like tickets on many general purpose project management tools. A new Issue can be raised by anyone on GitHub (provided the repo is public) to indicate a problem with the current codebase. This can be security bugs, incorrect documentation and source code alignment, unexpected behaviour or even new features users want to request from the project. Issues on GitHub have many additional features for contributors to be able to easily link development with Issue tracking. Additional features and controls for Issues can be found on the UI panel component to the right (except the discussion thread).

## Discussion Thread

Following the original creation of an Issue and its description, collaborators can reply to the Issue using the discussion thread. This is a history of all actions and comments made on an Issue and can be used to focus discussions about the Issue at the Issue's location. You can also add reactions to an Issue or comment.

## Closing an Issue

In the dialog box that is used to craft a comment, there is an option to close the Issue which marks the Issue as resolved or alternatively, you can close an Issue as "Won't Fix" meaning the Issue will not be resolved or considered. You can also reopen the Issue if it persists or becomes an Issue again.

## Todos

Using a Markdown checklist in the description of an Issue will add a todo meter and item count to the top of the Issue's page as well as to the Issues row on the 'Issues' tab. List can be treated like a regular todo/checklist list for anything that needs to be done to complete the Issue where you can tick/untick items as you go and it will be reflected in the UI.

## Assignees

Assignees allow you to add a person you want to work on a particular Issue. You can assign individual users or teams within an organisation.

## Labels

Labels are descriptor tags that can make it easier to categorise Issues, allowing us to find or group common Issues together.

## Projects

This section allows you to add your Issue to a project board and have it tracked by GitHub automatically allowing for better integration between a repo's Issues and the general management of the team or organisation.

## Milestones

You can make an Issue a part of a milestone's progress.

## Development

This section allows you to easily create and track branches linked to the progression of the Issue.

## Notifications

Change your notification settings for the Issue

## Participants

View who is/has been involved in an Issue.

## Lock conversations

Lock the conversation from further modifications (usually for archival purposes)

## Pin Issues

Pin the Issue on the repos main 'Issues' tab putting it at the forefront of all collaborators' view.

## Convert to Discussion

Convert the Issue, its discussion thread and tags to a dedicated discussion.

## Deleting an Issue

Delete the Issue from existence.

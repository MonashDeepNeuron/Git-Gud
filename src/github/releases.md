# Tags and Releases

We saw Git chapter tags and how they can be used to create named commit points, often for marking versions of the codebase. GitHub takes this to the next step by allowing you to use tags to create GitHub releases where you can store your packaged versions of the codebase and share what has changed to your users. It can even generate crude changelogs for you based on commit message (a good reason to create good commit messages).

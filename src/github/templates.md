# Template Repositories

When creating repositories, you have the option of creating the repository as a template repository. This can be useful for creating a skeleton for a project that you wish to distribute but be disconnected from the upstream source. This option is a checkbox located above the text field where you enter the repos name. You can then either clone the template to update the template itself or copy the template to use it as the starting point for your new project.

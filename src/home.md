# Welcome

Welcome to _Git Gud_, an introductory book and reference to using the Git-SCM tool and the GitHub platform. In this book, you will learn how to utilise the Git Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage the development, distribution, tracking and versioning of software as well as utilise the online platform GitHub to store this information remotely, run Continuous Integration (CI) jobs, contribute to Closed Source and Open Source Software (OSS), integrate your changes into large codebases and publish your own software.

## How to use this book

Using the book is pretty self-explanatory. The content is split up into chapters which cover a particular topic which can be further broken down into sections. You navigate through the book mostly chronologically using the arrow buttons on either side of the page (can't miss them). You can also look through the chapters and sections to find particular topics or use the search bar, which can be activated by pressing <kbd>S</kbd>. Each chapter has a challenges section. These contain various tasks to complete related to the content of each chapter.
